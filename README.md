## About the project


The task was to create a Music Search System using Laravel and React.
The project owner uses Laravel 11 and harnessed the power of initial to design a full stack application using Laravel as the backend and reactjs as frontend of choice.

The code will most propably not execute coz I broke something to do with Laravel file classes.
